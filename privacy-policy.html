  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> August 16, 2025</p>
  <p>This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>Grandfan</strong> (“we”, “us”, or “our”) collects, uses, and shares information when you use our application.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect & Why</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Camera Access (android.permission.CAMERA):</strong> Used to capture photos or scan content as part of app features. Images and camera input are processed solely to provide this functionality.</li>
    <li><strong>Optional Storage/Media Access (if applicable):</strong> To save or pick images/files at your request.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Handle Data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We do <strong>not</strong> access the camera without your action (e.g., tapping a capture/scan button).</li>
    <li>We do <strong>not</strong> store or transmit camera data to our servers. All images remain on your device unless you choose to share or upload them.</li>
    <li>We do not sell or rent your personal data.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>If we integrate third-party SDKs (e.g., analytics, ads, or crash reporting), those services may process limited data under their own privacy policies. (Example: Google Analytics, AdMob).</p>

  <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>We retain data only for as long as needed to provide requested features or comply with legal obligations. Camera images remain on your device unless you delete them.</p>

  <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>Our app is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

  <h2>6. Your Choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can deny camera permission in device settings. Certain features may not work without it.</li>
    <li>You can delete app-generated files from your device at any time.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Security</h2>
  <p>We implement reasonable safeguards to protect your information, but no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

  <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy. We will update the “Effective date” above whenever changes are made.</p>

  <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us at: <a href="mailto:your-email@example.com">your-email@example.com</a></p>
